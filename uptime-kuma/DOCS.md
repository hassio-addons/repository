# Home Assistant Community App: Uptime Kuma

Uptime Kuma is an open source monitor tools, which can be best
compared to a self-hosted variant of a commercial service like "Uptime Robot".

It enables you to monitor services over HTTP/S, TCP, DNS, and other protocols
and it can send you notifications of downtime or trigger an Home Assistant
automation webhook.

## Installation

The installation of this app is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant app.

1. Click the Home Assistant My button below to open the app on your Home
   Assistant instance.
