# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Uptime Kuma

Uptime Kuma is an open source monitor tools, which can be best
compared to a self-hosted variant of a commercial service like "Uptime Robot".

It enables you to monitor services over HTTP/S, TCP, DNS, and other protocols
and it can send you notifications of downtime or trigger an Home Assistant
automation webhook.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

   Assistant instance.
