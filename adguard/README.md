Network-wide ads & trackers blocking DNS server.

## About

AdGuard Home is a network-wide ad-and-tracker blocking DNS server with
parental control (adult content blocking) capabilities. Its purpose is to let
you control your entire network and all your devices, and it does not require
using a client-side program.

AdGuard Home provides a beautiful, easy and feature-rich web interface to
easily manage the filtering process and its settings.
