Smart PVR for newsgroup and bittorrent users.

## About

[Sonarr] is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS
feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename
them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files
already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.
