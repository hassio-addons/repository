# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Example

This is an example add-on for Home Assistant. When started, it displays a
random quote every 5 seconds.

It shows off several features and structures like:

- Full blown GitHub repository.
- General Dockerfile structure and setup.
- The use of the `config.yaml` and `build.yaml` files.
- General shell scripting structure (`run.sh`).
- Quality assurance using CodeClimate.
- Continuous integration and deployment using GitLab.
- Usage of the Community Home Assistant Add-ons build environment.
- Small use of the Bash function library in our base images.
- The use of Docker label schema.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Click the Home Assistant My button below to open the add-on on your Home
   Assistant instance.

1. Click the "Install" button to install the add-on.
1. Start the "Example" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Example" add-on to see it in action.

## Configuration

Eventought this add-on is just an example add-on, it does come with some
configuration options to play around with.

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
seconds_between_quotes: 5
```

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the add-on and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `seconds_between_quotes`

Sets the number of seconds between the output of each quote. The value
must be between `1` and `120` seconds. This value is set to `5` seconds by
default.
