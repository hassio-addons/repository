configuration:
  accept_dns:
    name: Accept DNS
    description: >-
      If you are experiencing trouble with MagicDNS on this device and wish to
      disable, you can do so using this option.
      When not set, this option is enabled by default.
  accept_routes:
    name: Accept Routes
    description: >-
      This option allows you to accept subnet routes advertised by other nodes
      in your tailnet.
      When not set, this option is enabled by default.
  advertise_exit_node:
    name: Advertise as an exit node
    description: >-
      This option allows you to advertise this Tailscale instance as an exit node.
      By setting a device on your network as an exit node, you can use it to
      route all your public internet traffic as needed, like a consumer VPN.
      When not set, this option is enabled by default.
  advertise_routes:
    name: Advertise subnet routes
    description: >-
      This option allows you to advertise routes to subnets (accessible on the network
      your device is connected to) to other clients on your tailnet.
      When not set, the add-on by default will advertise routes to your subnets on all
      supported interfaces.
  funnel:
    name: Tailscale Funnel
    description: >-
      This option allows you to enable Tailscale's Funnel feature to present your
      Home Assistant instance on the wider internet using your Tailscale domain.
      This requires Tailscale Proxy to be enabled.
      When not set, this option is enabled by default.
  log_level:
    name: Log level
    description: >-
      Controls the level of log details the add-on provides.
      This only applies to the add-on itself, not Tailscale.
  login_server:
    name: Login server
    description: >-
      This option allows you to specify a custom control server for this
      Tailscale instance, for example, a self-host Headscale instance.
      By default, it uses the control server provided by Tailscale.
  proxy:
    name: Tailscale Proxy
    description: >-
      This option allows you to enable Tailscale's Proxy feature to present your
      Home Assistant instance on your tailnet with a valid certificate.
      When not set, this option is enabled by default.
  snat_subnet_routes:
    name: Source NAT subnet routes
    description: >-
      This option allows subnet devices to see the traffic originating from the
      subnet router, and this simplifies routing configuration.
      To support advanced Site-to-site networking (eg. to traverse multiple
      networks), you can disable this functionality.
      When not set, this option is enabled by default.
  tags:
    name: Tags
    description: >-
      This option allows you to specify specific ACL tags for this
      Tailscale instance. They need to start with `tag:`.
  taildrop:
    name: Taildrop
    description: >-
      This option allows you to enable Taildrop, a file sharing service
      that allows you to share files with other Tailscale nodes.
      When not set, this option is enabled by default.
  userspace_networking:
    name: Userspace networking mode
    description: >-
      This option allows you to enable userspace networking mode.
      If you need to access other clients on your Tailnet from your Home
      Assistant instance, disable userspace networking mode, which will create a
      `tailscale0` network interface on your host.
      When not set, this option is enabled by default.
