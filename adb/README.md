The Android Debug Bridge server program.

## Deprecation warning

**This add-on is in a deprecated state!**

This add-on was created at the time, that the best solution for communicating
with an Android device from Home Assistant, was using an Android Debug Bridge.

However, the time has changed. Right now, the Home Assistant project recommends
using built-in Python implementation, which renders this add-on obsolete.

Additionally, this add-on will become problematic to maintain in the future,
as the packages used are stalled.

Therefore, this add-on is now deprecated.

## About

The Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a client-server program used in Android
application development. This add-on provides the server program and can be
used to get full local control over your Android (TV) devices.
