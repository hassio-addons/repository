  latency_rtp:

      Allows you to tweak the buffering, which is needed when the audio is
      stuttering (e.g., low-quality network). This option specifies the number
      of ms the app has to buffer the RTP audio (AirPlay). Setting this value

      Allows you to tweak the buffering, which is needed when the audio is
      stuttering (e.g., low-quality network). This option specifies the number
