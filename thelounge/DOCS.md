# Home Assistant Community Add-on: The Lounge

A self-hosted web IRC client that uses a modern and sleek interface with
support for theming, push notifications, link previews, file uploads and
more. Fully cross-platform and mobile friendly.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Click the Home Assistant My button below to open the add-on on your Home
   Assistant instance.

   [![Open this add-on in your Home Assistant instance.][addon-badge]][addon]

1. Click the "Install" button to install the add-on.
1. Configure the "The Lounge" add-on. (See below)
1. Start the "The Lounge" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "The Lounge" add-on to see it in action.
1. Click "Open Web UI".

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
ssl: true
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
default_theme: default
themes:
  - thelounge-theme-material
users:
  - hassio
```

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the app. Set it `true` to enable it,
`false` otherwise.

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

### Option: `default_theme`

The default theme for each user. The pre-installed themes are `default` and
`morning`. You can add more using the next option.

**Note**: _The theme can still be changed in the settings of the app_

### Option: `themes`

A list of themes to install which can be found in the [npm registry][themes].
Use the name of the package. (refer to the example above)

### Option: `users`

A list of users to setup. At first, these will use the default password
`hassio`. **Make sure you change your password as soon as you login!**
