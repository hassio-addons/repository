## What’s changed

This release brings Portainer to their next major v2.x release.

⚠️ Portainer has removed custom authentication methods from their open-source version and commercialized those options, they called it an improvement/upgrade... 😡

This means, that even if you are authenticated as an admin within Home Assistant already, as of now, you have to login into the add-on as well. The add-on will ask you to set up an account the first time you access the interface.
