[Homebridge][homebridge].

## About

Homebridge is a server that emulates the iOS HomeKit API, allowing you to
control your Home Assistant via Apple devices (including Siri).

Since Siri supports devices added through HomeKit, this means that with
Homebridge you can ask Siri to control devices that don't have any support for
HomeKit at all. For instance, you could say:

- _Siri, unlock the back door._
- _Siri, open the garage door._
- _Siri, turn on the coffee maker._
- _Siri, turn on the living room lights._
- _Siri, good morning!_
