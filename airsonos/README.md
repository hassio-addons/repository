AirPlay capabilities for your Sonos (and UPnP) players.

## About

Apple devices use AirPlay to send audio to other devices, but this is not
compatible with Sonos players. This add-on tries to solve this
compatibility gap.

It detects Sonos players in your network and creates virtual AirPlay
devices for each of them. It acts as a bridge between the AirPlay client
and the real Sonos device.

Since Sonos uses UPnP, the add-on might also work for other UPnP players
(e.g., newer Samsung televisions).
