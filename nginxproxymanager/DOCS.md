# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Nginx Proxy Manager

This add-on enables you to easily forward incoming connections to anywhere,
including free SSL, without having to know too much about Nginx
or Let’s Encrypt.

Forward your domain to your Home Assistant, add-ons, or websites running
at home or anywhere else, straight from a simple, powerful interface.

Want to protect the website with a username/password? Well, it can do that too!
Enable authentication and create a list of usernames/password that can access
that specific application.

For the power users, you can customize the behavior of each host in the
Nginx proxy manager by providing additional Nginx directives.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Ensure you are running the MariaDB add-on. This add-on is required to use
   the Nginx Proxy Manager add-on as it uses the database services provided.
1. Search for the "Nginx Proxy Manager" add-on in the Supervisor add-on store
   and install it.
1. Start the "Nginx Proxy Manager" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "Nginx Proxy Manager" add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Click the "OPEN WEB UI" button and login using:
   `admin@example.com` / `changeme`
1. Forward port `80` and `443` from your router to your Home Assistant machine.
1. Enjoy the add-on!

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

## Known issues and limitations

- The original NGinx Proxy Manager has support for forwarding TCP/UDP streams,
  which is removed from this add-on. It makes no sense from a
  Home Assistant / Home perspective and, by removing it, it also
  removed the need for this add-on to run on the Docker host network.
- This add-on stores its database on the MariaDB add-on. This also means that
  by taking a snapshot of just the Nginx Proxy Manager add-on, will not
  contain the data from this add-on. Please make sure you backup both
  the Nginx Proxy Manager and the MariaDB add-ons.
