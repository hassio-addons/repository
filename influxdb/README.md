Scalable datastore for metrics, events, and real-time analytics.

## About

InfluxDB is an open source time series database optimized for high-write-volume.
It's useful for recording metrics, sensor data, events,
and performing analytics. It exposes an HTTP API for client interaction and if
often used in combination with Grafana to visualize the data.

This add-on comes with Chronograf & Kapacitor pre-installed as well. Which
gives you a nice InfluxDB admin interface for managing your users, databases,
data retention settings, and lets you peek inside the database using the
Data Explorer.
