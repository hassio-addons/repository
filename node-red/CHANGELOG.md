## What’s changed

**⚠️ 🚨 This release drops support for ARMv7**

After a few years of working around the upstream issues, I see no way out than to make a breaking change.
For references of upstream issues see: [#2016](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-node-red/pull/2016)

With that out of the way, this release upgraded Alpine Linux to 3.21 and NodeJS to 22.x, making this a huge upgrade.
Besides that, all the latest and greatest other dependencies are included as well.
